# Whormole
The idea is to model two timelines as two qubits, where each qubit represents the state of a different timeline. Then, we will use a SWAP gate to simulate the "travel" through the wormhole, swapping the states between the timelines.Model ConceptTwo timelines: Represented by two qubits (A and B).
